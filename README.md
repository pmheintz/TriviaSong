# TriviaSong iOS app

This iOS app simply launches the app and starts playing the song from _Jeopardy_.
The song will repeat indefinitely while the app is running. The app contains
a button to pause/play the song, another button to restart the song from the
beginning, and a slider that is synced with the song's playback time allowing
the user to _scrub_ the audio file to any position.

## Installation
